In this section we highlight state-level policies on renewable energy technologies, investments for project development, power purchase agreements, and renewable energy technology and business innovation.</p>\n"

More important is India’s need to get its people access to energy to maximize their ability to thrive in the changing climate of the future.

My recent journey through 11 of India’s 29 states, speaking with senior power officials, confirms that India has made incredible progress in tackling its power generation deficit. Increased generation capacity through new additions of renewables and greater efficiency and reliability of coal stocks for thermal power plants is coupling with the success of India’s incredible demand-side measures to create a perfect storm of plentiful power. However, the next set of problems for its power sector are in some ways more difficult to confront. To address those problems, India will have to employ a diverse and creative set of solutions."
